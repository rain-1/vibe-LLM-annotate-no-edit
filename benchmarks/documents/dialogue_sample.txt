"I can still save you," she said, her voice barely a whisper. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows of the old cabin.

"If you want to help," he started, but stopped himself. His hands were shaking.

She moved closer, reaching out. "Tell me what happened."

"You wouldn't believe me." He turned away, staring into the fire. The flames cast dancing shadows across his face.

"Try me." She placed a hand on his shoulder. "I've seen things too."

He laughed bitterly. "Not like this. Not like what I saw in those woods."

The room fell silent except for the crackling fire. She waited, patient as always.

Finally, he spoke. "It started three days ago. I was hiking the north trail when I heard something. A sound like nothing I'd ever heard before."

"What kind of sound?"

"Like voices. Hundreds of them, all speaking at once, but in a language that doesn't exist." He shuddered. "And then I saw it."

She didn't press him. She simply waited.

"A light," he whispered. "Not like any light you've seen. It moved through the trees like it was alive. Like it was looking for something. Or someone."
